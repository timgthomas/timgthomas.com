title: Prairie Dev Con 2015
---

Earlier this week, I had the extreme pleasure to return to Winnipeg, Manitoba, to speak at the 2015 edition of the [Prairie Dev Con](http://prairiedevcon.com/) (the conference’s ninth annual event).

I gave two talks at the event: first, an introduction to the [Broccoli](http://broccolijs.com/) build tool, entitled “Chocolate-Covered Vegetables”. We discussed how to use the build tool and some [essential plugins](http://broccoliplugins.com/) to get the most of it. Slides for the talk are [available on SpeakerDeck](https://speakerdeck.com/timgthomas/chocolate-covered-vegetables-tasty-workflows-with-broccoli):

On the second day, I presented on “Stateful CSS”: a way of adding behavior to web apps with no JavaScript. We discussed building [tabs](http://codepen.io/TimGThomas/pen/qijKp), [modals](http://codepen.io/TimGThomas/pen/KILyq), and [more](http://codepen.io/TimGThomas/pen/PwBYaZ), all with only CSS. The slides (themselves created using only CSS!) are [available on GitHub](https://github.com/TimGThomas/stateful-css-slides), and the code examples can be found in a [CodePen collection](http://codepen.io/collection/AWvrMk/).

PrDC is absolutely one of my favorite conferences, and I encourage you to check it out if you ever find yourself in the area in early spring. The organizer, [D’Arcy Lussier](http://geekswithblogs.net/dlussier/Default.aspx), knows how to put together a _seriously_ epic conference. If you have any feedback about my talks or their content, let me know in the comments!
