title: Simple Validation Visuals for Windows Phone 7
---

In the Windows Phone 7 app I'm working on, I'd like to provide some visual feedback for invalid input fields by outlining each one with the user's [selected accent color][1]. Ideally, invalid input boxes would look something like this:

![The goal.][a]

Unfortunately, WP7's template-based styling model makes this difficult, and the [workaround suggestions I've found][2] result in significant amounts of markup noise (not to mention adding the necessary XAML for that approach just duplicates Silverlight's internals).

One solution I've found to work well is to simply "stack" a pre-styled `Border` control on top of the `TextBox` you'd like to validate and control its visibility programmatically or with data binding (this example uses the former method). The markup is very straightforward...

      <Grid>
         <TextBox x:Name="FavoriteFood" />
         <Border x:Name="FavoriteFood_Validation" />
      </Grid>

...it's easy to style to match the Metro UI...

      <Style x:Name="ValidationHighlight" TargetType="Border">
         <Setter Property="BorderThickness" Value="3" />
         <Setter Property="Margin" Value="12" />

         <!-- Match the user's accent color. -->
         <Setter Property="BorderBrush" Value="{StaticResource PhoneAccentColor}" />

         <!-- Don't interfere with the TextBox's tappable area. -->
         <Setter Property="IsHitTestVisible" Value="False" />

         <!-- Remain invisible until the user tries to submit bad data. -->
         <Setter Property="Visibility" Value="Collapsed" />
      </Style>

...and it's trivial to show and hide to indicate validity.

      private void Validate()
      {
         // Perform some incredibly complex validation here, like so.
         bool favoriteFoodIsValid = FavoriteFood.Text.Length <= 32;

         FavoriteFood_Validation.Visibility = favoriteFoodIsValid ?
            Visibility.Collapsed : Visibility.Visible;
      }

Note that we're taking advantage of the [built-in Windows Phone 7 style resources][3] so the user gets a customized color for their invalid fields. The `Border` control's `IsHitTestVisible` property is set to `False` so it doesn't interfere with users trying to tap in the `TextBox`, and we're keeping the `Border` invisible until the input field is validated.

The end result looks something like this:

![The end result.][b]

Happy validating!
