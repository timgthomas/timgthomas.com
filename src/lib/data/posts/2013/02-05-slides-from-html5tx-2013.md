title: Slides from HTML5.tx 2013
---

Last Saturday, 2 February, I had the honor of presenting at the incredible [HTML5.tx][1] conference here in Austin, Texas. If you'd like to view the slides from my presentation, "Web Usability on a Budget", they're [located on SpeakerDeck][2].

Thanks to everyone who attended the conference (especially those who suffered through my talk). If you did stop in, I'd be very appreciative if you would help me improve by [rating this talk on SpeakerRate][3]. I hope to see you at more events in the future!
