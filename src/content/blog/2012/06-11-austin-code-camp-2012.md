title: Austin Code Camp 2012

The 2012 edition of [Austin Code Camp][0] last Saturday was a resounding success! Thanks to everyone who attended (especially those who survived one of my talks).

The slides for said talks are now up on SpeakerDeck. If you attended one (or both!), I'd greatly appreciate your feedback so I can improve these presentations in the future.
