title: Recreating the CTXNA Button Style in Pure CSS
---

Although the design of the [CTXNA Web site][1] makes extensive use of images (for browser compatability), I became curious how difficult the style would be to reproduce in nothing but CSS and threw together a demo using JSFiddle:

<iframe src="https://jsfiddle.net/TimGThomas/GyxaD/embedded/result,css,html"></iframe>

The complete sample requires a browser that supports CSS gradients and the `border-radius`, `box-shadow`, and `text-shadow` properties; however, older browser users will still be able to recogize the button even if it's not _quite_ so pretty. :)

Switching your graphics from using images to CSS has some great advantages:

- _More flexibility._ Modern design techniques typically involve a number of iterations, each one of which can involve a major rework of graphical elements. If your images have already been sliced and placed into your HTML, it can be a chore to re-export them from your graphics tool of choice. Using CSS instead means you can make iterative changes without starting over.
- _Fewer requests._ Instead of loading a CSS file _and_ several image files, browsers simply load a simple file, cutting down on slow loading times caused by network latency.
- _Smaller file sizes._ Though our example above is relatively complex, many images can be replaced with CSS with a significant reduction in file size (being text, CSS rules take up less space on disk than graphics). Given the average number of images on Web sites, this can lead to some serious page load time improvements!
