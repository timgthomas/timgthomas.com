title: NDC Oslo 2015
---

Earlier this month I had the pleasure of returning to Oslo, Norway, for another fantastic [Norwegian Developers Conference](http://www.ndcoslo.com/). As usual, the conference featured amazing speakers providing invaluable content, and I’m honored to have been asked to join them for a third year.

This year, I gave a talk on adding interactions to your web apps using only CSS, a topic on which I’ve frequently blogged in the past. A full recording of my talk is [on Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/131410261), and embedded below. The talk’s slides—written entirely with HTML and CSS—[can be viewed online](http://timgthomas.github.io/stateful-css-slides/) and are [on GitHub](https://github.com/TimGThomas/stateful-css-slides), as well.

> As the web becomes a more vivid, interactive medium, page payloads increase dramatically. Images, templates, and behavioral plugins add needed richness, but also code complexity and, yes, file size. Fortunately, there's an unusual way to add some great interactions to your web apps without bloating your pages: with CSS!
