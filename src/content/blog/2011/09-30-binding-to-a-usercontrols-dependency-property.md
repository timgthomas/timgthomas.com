title: Binding to a UserControl's Dependency Property
---

NOTE: This post's code was written for Windows Phone 7 and may or may not work with other versions of Silverlight or WPF.

One of the screens in the Windows Phone 7 app I'm currently working on (we'll call it `CombatForm`) contains some combat tools for two separate players, implemented as a parent page with two child controls. These controls–each one an instance of the `CombatActions` control–need to change their state based on a property of the parent screen (which is in turn manipulated by user input elsewhere in the app). After mulling over several options (including using the application's event bus and a more synchronous approach of manually modifying the controls' properties), I decided to use Silverlight's built-in data binding features to implement this, meaning I needed to create a [`DependencyProperty`][1].

Creating the `DependencyProperty` on the `CombatActions` control was pretty straightforward. Essentially, we're creating some metadata about the property on the `UserControl` we want, then using some of the Silverlight API's calls to expose the property:

      public partial class CombatActions : UserControl
      {
         // ...

         public static readonly DependencyProperty CanCastSpellsProperty =
            DependencyProperty.Register("CanCastSpells", typeof(bool),
            typeof(CombatActions), null);

         public bool CanCastSpells
         {
            get { return (bool)GetValue(CanCastSpellsProperty); }
            set { SetValue(CanCastSpellsProperty, value); }
         }

         // ...
      }

Ideally, I'd like to bind the parent property to the UserControl in XAML, which _would_ have looked like this:

      <c:CombatActions x:Name="Actions" CanCastSpells="{Binding CanCastSpells}" />

Unfortunately, I spent more time than I'd care to admit trying to figure out why that wasn't working. Having given up any hope of a utopian XAML solution, I attempted the binding in the parent control's code-behind:

      public class CombatForm : PhoneApplicationPage
      {
         public bool CanCastSpells { get; set; }

         public CombatForm()
         {
            // ...

            // In this example, we're binding the UserControl to a property on this
            // instance of CombatForm, so the DataContext is "this".
            DataContext = this;

            Actions.SetBinding(CombatActions.CanCastSpellsProperty, new Binding
               {
                  Source = DataContext,
                  Path = new PropertyPath("CanCastSpells"),
                  Mode = BindingMode.TwoWay
               });

            // ...
         }
      }

Success! The `CanCastSpells` property on the `CombatActions` controls can now be successfully bound to the `CombatForm`'s property of the same name! The key was to create the binding programmatically (in the code-behind) rather than declaratively (in the XAML).
