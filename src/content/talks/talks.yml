  description: "Developers and designers rarely speak the same language. As wireframes turn into web apps, points become pixels, hues are coerced into hex values…it's no wonder a schism exists between these two essential disciplines! Fortunately, it doesn't have to be that way. In this session, we'll dive into the world of living style guides: the perfect pairing of design and code. We’ll explore how to architect your apps to make use of style guides, make design apps work for you and your design team, and reign in your varying component styles, all while providing your users a more consistent and refined experience!"

  thumbnail: icons-and-the-web.jpg
  description: Icons have been a staple of software for decades, and come in as many varieties as the tools used to make them.

  thumbnail: constructing-modern-uis.jpg
  description: "We've built web interfaces roughly the same way for years: with a few HTML tags, some arcane CSS, and a whole lotta crossed fingers for luck. Fortunately, a better way is on the horizon, and it promises to revolutionize the way UIs are designed. In this session, you'll learn how to use Scalable Vector Graphics to modernize your web UIs without sacrificing the code-based workflows you're used to, and bring a touch of the future to your apps along the way."

  thumbnail: browser-invasion.jpg
  description: "The web’s biggest strength is that it’s universal: build a web site, and anyone with a browser and connection can access it. Desktop apps, however, have long been off-limits to web developers…but times change. Today, more and more apps are built with web technologies, and the benefits are many. In this session, you’ll learn how to use the tools and languages you already know to build rich, fully-featured desktop apps, and conquer a new galaxy of apps!"

  thumbnail: mind-the-gap.jpg
  description: Developers and designers rarely speak the same language. As wireframes turn into web pages, points become pixels, HSB colors are coerced into RGB hex values... It's no wonder a schism exists between these two essential disciplines, but it doesn't have to be that way. In this session, we'll cover a number of techniques to reduce context switching—and increase understanding—across the design/code boundary. You'll find it's not too tricky to take that first step into more efficient collaboration...provided you mind the gap!

  thumbnail: zero-to-app-store.jpg
  description: "A lot goes into making a mobile app: from visual and interaction design to prototyping, then coding and testing, and finally the nerve-wracking submission process: it can seem overwhelming for an experienced team, much less a single developer. In this session, you'll get to cheer me on as I enthuse about my wild successes building a hybrid app, and have a good laugh at my expense while I discuss my abysmal failures. We'll also touch on some tooling and workflows that contribute to the longest journey of hybrid app development."

  thumbnail: chocolate-covered-vegetables.jpg
  description: Arguably, one of the best trends in software is that building it requires less and less overhead. While once developers used punch cards to perform even the most basic of mathematical calculations, we can now make changes to live web sites in a browser and see the results instantly. In this session, you'll learn how to use Broccoli, a blazingly-fast new asset pipeline tool, to dramatically cut down the time it takes to build for the web. We'll also explore other tools and methods that work well with Broccoli, and build the web workflow you've always hungered for.

  description: "As the web becomes a more vivid, interactive medium, page payloads increase dramatically. Images, templates, and behavioral plugins add needed richness, but also code complexity and, yes, file size. Fortunately, there's an unusual way to add some great interactions to your web apps without bloating your pages: with CSS!"

  description: Not all projects have the budget for UX designers; as a result, experience in disciplines such as user research, interaction design, and information architecture are often expected of all developers on a team. Fortunately, these arcane-sounding topics are far from impossible to grasp for mere programmer mortals. In this session, you'll learn some easy tricks to make your sites more approachable, discover ways to help develop an emotional connection between your apps and your users, and see some tools that can assist you with planning and designing your next masterpiece of usability.
