If you’ve spent any amount of time speaking with me about coding, you’ve probably heard me enthuse about typefaces. Much like mattresses are the unsung heroes of a full third of our lives, coding fonts are rarely discussed, but constantly stared at.

In the tradition of trying out new things for the new year, I want to share a few of my favorite coding typefaces. If you've been staring at the same letterforms for a while, maybe consider a change!

## SF Mono

A relative newcomer, SF Mono is Apple’s monospace variant for its fantastic [San Francisco family](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/). It comes in six weights (useful if you use multiple sizes at once) and features some of the same personality its proportional cousins bring to macOS. If you own a Sierra-or-thereafter Mac, you already have it, though it [takes some steps to install](https://simonfredsted.com/1438).

## Fira Mono/Fira Code

I’m a huge fan of the [Fira family](https://mozilla.github.io/Fira/) (as of this writing, this blog uses Fira exclusively), and its [monospaced version](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Mono) is no exception. The slightly whimsical serifs don’t detract from the business of programming, and it’s surprisingly readable at any size. The [alternate “Code” version](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) adds programming-specific ligatures, if that’s your thing.

## PT Mono

The [PT family](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/PT+Sans) traces its origins to Russian typefaces, and you can still detect the hint of Cyrillic letterforms in its [monospaced](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/PT+Mono) form. It’s limited to two weights, so beware if you find yourself shifting between display pixel densities.

## Verily Serif Mono

If a traditional, literary typeface is more your style, give [Verily](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/verily-serif-mono) a try. Its refined serifs seem plucked from your favorite hardcover, though I find it grows quickly distracting on-screen.

## Fantasque Sans Mono

If you like your text editor on the playful side, [Fantasque](https://fontlibrary.org/en/font/fantasque-sans-mono) is for you. For a typeface described as “the mutant child of Comic Sans and Helvetica Neue”, Fantasque looks quite good on languages from JavaScript to HTML.

## As For Me…

I’m going to give Adobe’s excellent [Source Code Pro](https://adobe-fonts.github.io/source-code-pro/) a few weeks on my editor’s surface. It’s a lovely standby that always helps me clear my head. After that, who knows? [I might just go nuts](https://www.dafont.com/monofur.font):

What about you? Have I missed your favorite? Have a visceral reaction to any of these? Weigh in below, and happy coding!
